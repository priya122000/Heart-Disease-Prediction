# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this project, we’ll simply predict that the person has heart disease or is not(healthy) using classifiers like DecisionTree Classifier, LogisticRegression, etc. we’ll analyze the relationship between the features(or attributes) of the heart disease patients included in this dataset namely the distribution of age among the patient, rate of heart disease or healthy patient, percentage of male and female people, variation in the serum cholesterol amount, the person’s heart rate, chest pain experienced people, level of the restecg, exang, etc. In Python, the most powerful library is NumPy and Pandas. The graphical representation of data using the Matplotlib, Seaborn &amp; Plotly library in python helps us to easily understand a lot better about the dataset.
